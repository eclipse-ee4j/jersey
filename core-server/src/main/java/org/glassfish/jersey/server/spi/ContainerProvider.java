/**
 * Service-provider interface for creating container instances.
 *
 * If supported by the provider, a container instance of the requested Java type
 * will be created.
 * <p>
 * The created container is responsible for listening on a communication chanel
 * for new client requests, dispatching these requests to the registered
 * {@link ApplicationHandler Jersey application handler} using the handler's
 * {@link ApplicationHandler#handle(org.glassfish.jersey.server.ContainerRequest)}
 * handle(requestContext)} method and sending the responses provided by the
 * application back to the client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A provider shall support a one-to-one mapping between a type, provided the type
 * is not {@link Object}. A provider may also support mapping of sub-types of a type
 * (provided the type is not {@code Object}). It is expected that each provider
 * supports mapping for distinct set of types and subtypes so that different providers
 * do not conflict with each other.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An implementation can identify itself by placing a Java service provider configuration
 * file (if not already present) - {@code org.glassfish.jersey.server.spi.ContainerProvider}
 * - in the resource directory {@code META-INF/services}, and adding the fully
 * qualified service-provider-class of the implementation in the file.
 * </p>
