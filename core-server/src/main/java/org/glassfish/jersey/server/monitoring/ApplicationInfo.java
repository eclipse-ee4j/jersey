/**
 * Monitoring configuration of an application.
 * <p/>
 * Application info instance can be injected, e.g:
 * <pre>
 *   &#064;Path("resource")
 *   public static class ApplicationInfoTest {
 *       &#064;Inject
 *       Provider&lt;ApplicationInfo&gt; applicationInfoProvider;
 *
 *       &#064;GET
 *       public String getAppName() throws InterruptedException {
 *           final ApplicationInfo applicationInfo = appInfoProvider.get();
 *           final String name = applicationInfo.getResourceConfig().getApplicationName();
 *
 *           return name;
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Note usage of {@link javax.inject.Provider} to retrieve application info. Info changes over time and this will
 * inject the latest info. In the case of singleton resources usage of {@code Provider} is the only way how
 * to inject application info that are up to date.
 * <p/>
 * Application info retrieved from Jersey runtime might be mutable and thanks to it might provide inconsistent data
 * as not all attributes are updated in the same time. To retrieve the immutable and consistent
 * data the method {@link #snapshot()} should be used.
