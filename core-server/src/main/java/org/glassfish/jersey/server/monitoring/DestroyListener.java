/**
 * A listener contract that allows any registered implementation class to receive application destroy events.

 * The {@link #onDestroy()} method is called when application is being destroyed and after all the pending

 * <p>
 * The advantage of using {@code DestroyListener} over using {@link ApplicationEventListener} directly to check for the
 * {@link ApplicationEvent.Type#DESTROY_FINISHED} event is, that the {@link #onDestroy()}
 * method is guaranteed to be called only AFTER all the {@code MonitoringStatisticsListener#onStatistics()} events have been
 * dispatched and processed, as opposed to using the {@code ApplicationEventListener} directly, in which case some monitoring
 * statistics events may still be concurrently fired after the {@code DESTROY_FINISHED} event has been dispatched
 * (due to potential race conditions).
