/**
 * Jersey client connector provider contract.

 * Connector provider is invoked by Jersey client runtime to provide a client connector
 * to be used to send client requests over the wire to server-side resources.
 * There can be only one connector provider registered in a single Jersey client instance.
 * <p>
 * Note that unlike most of the other {@link org.glassfish.jersey.spi.Contract Jersey SPI extension contracts},
 * {@code ConnectorProvider} is not a typical runtime extension and as such cannot be registered
 * using a configuration {@code register(...)} method. Instead, it must be registered using via
 * {@link org.glassfish.jersey.client.JerseyClientBuilder} using it's
 * {@link org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig#connectorProvider(ConnectorProvider)}
 * initializer method.
