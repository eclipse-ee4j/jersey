                            The most fundamental change in Jersey &version; and later is namespace change.
                            Since Jakarta EE 9 the <literal>jakarta.</literal> namespace is introduced as a replacement
                            for javax namespace from Java EE.

                            Due to required jakartification several modules where omitted (because of not satisfied dependencies).
                            Or require higher JDK (11+).

                            Examples and tests are reduced in quantity (so you probably will not find all those examples which were available
