--------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------
**_/helloworld/{name}_**    | HelloWorldResource  |  GET         |  Returns `Hello {name}`
**_/counter/request_**      | CounterResource     |  GET         |  Returns always `1` (injected always a new instance of counter)
**_/counter/application_**  | CounterResource     |  GET         |  Returns an incremented number (injected always the same counter).
